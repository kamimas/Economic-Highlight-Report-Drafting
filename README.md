# Economic-Highlight-Report-Drafting

This is an earlier version of an automation solution that I developed. It enables the users to catch a glimpse of the latest economic highlights provided by StatCan for Alberta. This tool can more significantly be utilized to generate a report on the changes in the market.

The smart algorithm will generate a paragraph of the highlights of the economic indicators and stamp a date on the word document. The document can later be used by the investors in Alberta to make better economical decisions.

This tool simplifies report generations for corporations; providing more time to focus on other more time consuming issues.

# Technicalities

The software is developed in python. There are a number of libraries used to pre-process the spreadsheet such as pandas. 

For the User Interface, PyQt5 was used since the Qt Library includes a designer that makes the developing process easier.


# How to use the software

Download all the files and simply run AdvanceUi8.py with python3
